# Starship Takeoff
A Golang clone of Starship Takeoff. 

I recently saw a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo47qPvs3HQ) of [Kari](https://www.karilawler.com/) creating the Starship Takeoff game from a book on the ZX Spectrum. After watching, I wondered whether I could replicate the functionality in Golang. The result is this repository.
